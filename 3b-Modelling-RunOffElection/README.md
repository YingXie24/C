# Runoff.c

This programme models the voting process  during an election, with two voting models:
1. Plurality vote
1. Runoff vote

In the runoff vote:
* Every voter ranks their preferences.
* If a candidate has a majority (more than half) of the votes, they are the winner.
* Otherwise, eliminate the candidate with the fewest votes and re-run the election without them.
* Repeat process until someone wins.

In **marioless.c**, I recreated the pyramid in C, using hashes (#) for bricks. The programme allows the user to decide just how tall the pyramid should be, for a positive integer between 1 and 8 inclusive. 

Here's how the program will work if the user inputs *8* when prompted:

In **mariomore.c**, I recreated these pyramids, allowing the user to decide the height of the pyramids between a positive integer between 1 and 8 inclusive. 

Here's how the program will work if the user inputs *8* when prompted:

1. Implement **cash.c**. Based on the *greedy algorithm*, the programme provides cashiers the way to minimise numbers of coins when making a change. 
1. Implement **credit.c**. Based on the *Luhn's algorithm*, the programme determines if a credit card number is valid and evaluates whether the card is Amex, Mastercard or Visa.

# Marioless.c

Toward the end of World 1-1 in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must ascend right-aligned pyramid of blocks, a la the below.

In **marioless.c**, I recreated the pyramid in C, using hashes (#) for bricks. The programme allows the user to decide just how tall the pyramid should be, for a positive integer between 1 and 8 inclusive. 

Here's how the program will work if the user inputs *8* when prompted:



## What I have learnt:
* Being comfortable with the command line.
* C and compilers.
* Data types, operators, conditional statements, loops, variables and user input.
* Memory, imprecision and overflow.
* Solving real-world problems using C. 

## Projects:
1. Implement **marioless.c**, a programme that prints Mario's right-aligned half pyramid of hashes of user-input height.
1. Implement **mariomore.c**, a more challenging code that prints two adjacent pyramids, again of user-input height.
1. Implement **cash.c**. Based on the *greedy algorithm*, the programme provides cashiers the way to minimise numbers of coins when making a change. 
1. Implement **credit.c**. Based on the *Luhn's algorithm*, the programme determines if a credit card number is valid and evaluates whether the card is Amex, Mastercard or Visa.
